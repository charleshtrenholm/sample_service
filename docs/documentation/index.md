# Documentation

Documentation in this repo covers the development, operation, and design of the Sample Service. It may contain some information about other KBase or 3rd party systems as they relate to the Sample Service.

It does not cover:
- user documentation
- whole system

All documentation is contained in the following locations: 
- the `/docs` directory contains the bulk of documentation and diagrams
- the `README.md` document contains brief information about this repo and a pointer to documents
- the `RELEASE_NOTES.md` document follows ____ and should note all notable changes to this repo
- the `LICENSE` file contains the standard KBase license in plain text format

All text other than the license is written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), specifically [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Diagrams are in [Plant UML](https://plantuml.com) format, which are exported and embedded as `.png` files.

## Editing

It is recommended to edit documentation with a markdown editor which provides syntax highlighting and live preview. This may be an external editor, such as [Mark Text](https://marktext.app), or a coding IDE which provides such support.

One successful platform is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which provides support for both Markdown and PlantUML via plugins, as well as top-notch coding Python support.

Another excellent IDE is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) which similarly provides full support for both Markdown and PlantUML via plugins.
